Network topology:
- 4 nodes
- 3 ranging communications involving the same target node
- 2 forwarding communications involving the same target node

Variables:
- SCH: channel offet
- STS: timeslot

Constraints:
- ranging communications can not be scheduled in same cell
- forwarding communications can not be scheduled in same cell
- 1 ranging and 1 forwarding can be scheduled in same cell 
	if sender and receiver node performing forwarding not involved in ranging
- max channel and timeslot available

Objective:
Minimize slotframe size
