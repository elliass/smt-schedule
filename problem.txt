Network topology:
- 4 nodes
- 3 ranging communications involving the same target node
- 2 forwarding communications involving the same target node

Variables:
- SCH: channel offet
- STS: timeslot

Constraints:
- ranging communications can not be scheduled in same cell
- forwarding communications can not be scheduled in same cell
- 1 ranging and 1 forwarding can be scheduled in same cell 
	if sender and receiver node performing forwarding not involved in ranging
- max channel and timeslot available

Objective:
Minimize slotframe size

----------------
Input:
----------------
Define topology
Define communications
Define number of constraints 
Define slotframe size based on constraints

----------------
Output:
----------------
Verify results
Evaluate quality


To do: 
- Log results for each run to gather metrics for evaluation 
- Sensitivity analysis and generate logs
- Give the possibility to increase the problem and analyse the sensibility
- Generalize and Test solution reliability with complex topology
- Allow cross cell communications



Done:
- Verify solution not working properly -> improve 
- Handle exception (CAP, dependency, conflict exception) and create exception class
- Add a function edge.is_cap()
- Add communication between root and root to simulate forwarding betwwen t1 and a1 and forwarding to localization engine
(not included but just need to remove condition in setup_topology: Add forwarding communications)
- Allow parent - child forwarding communications to the root node
- Add recursive parent_node forwarding communication 
- Shared network control communications


Remove
- Change logic for constraints using node.get_communication
- Update constraint generation using OOP
